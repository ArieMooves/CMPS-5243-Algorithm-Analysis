# P01: BST Delete
## Aretha Fontaine
### The following project displays how a delete method can be implemented in a Binary Search Tree, allowing recursive node deletion. 
### Test cases are inserted to allow you to visualize the various traversal operations that can be performed with this new method (delete).

The cases you handled for deletion.
The logic behind choosing a replacement value for nodes with two children.
Any challenges you faced while implementing deletion.
